Understanding the “Canon Printer Offline” Error
-----------------------------------------------

The “printer offline” error message means your computer and Canon printer are not communicating properly. Even though the printer is powered on and connected, the system treats it as unavailable.

Common Causes of the Error
--------------------------

- Loose USB or faulty wireless connections  
- Outdated or corrupted printer drivers  
- Wrong default printer selection  
- Enabled “Use Printer Offline” mode in Windows  
- Network conflicts after router updates  
- Firewall or security software blocking communication  
- Sleep mode or power-saving settings in the printer  

By identifying the cause, you can apply the right solution faster.

Fixing Canon Printer Offline Issue on Windows 10/11
---------------------------------------------------

Check the Printer’s Physical Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start with the basics. If you’re using a USB connection, ensure the cable is firmly plugged into both the computer and printer. For wireless printers, confirm that Wi-Fi is active and the printer is connected to the same network as your PC.

Set Canon as the Default Printer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes Windows automatically changes the default printer to another device. To fix this:

- Open Control Panel > Devices and Printers  
- Right-click your Canon printer and select *Set as Default Printer*  
- Retry printing to check if the error is resolved  

Disable “Use Printer Offline” Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows has an option that forces the system to treat the printer as offline.

- Go to Devices and Printers  
- Right-click your Canon printer and select *See What’s Printing*  
- Click on *Printer* from the top menu  
- Uncheck the box that says *Use Printer Offline*  

Restart the Print Spooler Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The print spooler manages print jobs in Windows. If it malfunctions, the printer may appear offline.

- Press **Windows + R** and type ``services.msc``  
- Locate *Print Spooler* in the list  
- Right-click and choose *Restart*  

Update or Reinstall Printer Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Driver issues are among the top reasons for a Canon printer offline on Windows 10/11.

- Open Device Manager  
- Expand *Printers*  
- Right-click your Canon printer and select *Update driver*  
- If no update is found, uninstall the printer and reinstall the latest driver from Canon’s support website  

Run the Windows Troubleshooter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows has a built-in printer troubleshooter that automatically detects and fixes common issues.

- Open Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot  
- Select *Printer* and run the troubleshooter  

Fixing Network-Related Offline Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Canon printer connects via Wi-Fi:

- Ensure your PC and printer are on the same Wi-Fi band (2.4 GHz is most reliable)  
- Restart your router and printer together  
- Assign a static IP to your Canon printer through the router settings to prevent disconnections  

Fixing Canon Printer Offline on Mac
-----------------------------------

Verify Printer Power and Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your Canon printer is powered on and connected to Wi-Fi. On the printer’s control panel, check the Wi-Fi status icon. If disconnected, reconnect to your wireless network before proceeding.

Check Default Printer Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Mac, go to Apple Menu > System Preferences > Printers & Scanners. If another printer is selected as default, switch back to your Canon printer.

Reset the Printing System on Mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the printer continues showing offline, reset the printing system:

- Open *Printers & Scanners*  
- Right-click (or Control-click) the printer list  
- Select *Reset printing system*  
- Add your Canon printer again by clicking the + button  

Delete Stuck Print Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pending print jobs can cause the Mac to mark your Canon printer as offline.

- Open *Printers & Scanners*  
- Select your Canon printer  
- Open the print queue and delete all pending jobs  

Update Canon Printer Drivers on Mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Driver compatibility is essential for smooth operation. Download the latest Canon drivers compatible with macOS from Canon’s support page and install them. If you’re running macOS Monterey, Ventura, or Sonoma, ensure your driver version matches your OS version.

Check Firewall and Security Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the Mac firewall or third-party security software may block printer communication. Temporarily disable the firewall and retry printing. If this fixes the issue, allow the Canon printer as an exception in firewall settings.

Use AirPrint for Wireless Printing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If drivers are outdated or unavailable, Mac devices often work with Canon printers using AirPrint. This driverless printing feature allows seamless printing over Wi-Fi without installing additional software.

Advanced Fixes for Canon Printer Offline Issues
-----------------------------------------------

Assigning a Static IP Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your printer frequently switches offline, assign it a static IP address. This prevents the router from automatically changing the printer’s IP, which breaks communication.

Firmware Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating your Canon printer’s firmware resolves compatibility issues with modern routers and operating systems. Firmware updates also fix bugs that may cause offline errors.

USB vs. Wireless Printing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If wireless printing continues to fail, try connecting your printer via USB to confirm if the issue is network-related. If it works over USB, you’ll know the problem lies in Wi-Fi connectivity rather than the printer itself.

Power Management Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some printers go into deep sleep mode and appear offline. Disable eco or sleep settings in your Canon printer’s control panel if the offline issue occurs after long idle periods.

Preventing Canon Printer Offline Problems
-----------------------------------------

- Regularly update printer drivers and firmware  
- Keep your printer close to the Wi-Fi router  
- Use the same network band for all devices  
- Restart router and printer periodically  
- Remove unused printers from your device’s printer list
